                <h2>Google's Start</h2>
                <pre>
                   Google started out in 1995 at Stanford University by Larry Page and Sergey Brin. But before that,
                   it was originally called Backruub. Over some time, they changed it to Google based on the number. 
                   Eventually, more people started to gain interest especially that of high profile Silicon Valley's
                   venture captilasts and firms. Then in 1998, Andy Bechtolsheim wrote the two a check 100 grand; 
                   the name Google had been established and starting spreading like wildfire.

                    Today, the term Google is so well known that its become a verb to desribe of searching
                    the internet for info. It had gone through so many different updates but the main message 
                    is there: to enable the ability for anyone to search for anything anywhere.
