                   The tech industry no longer revolves around Silicon Valley. The tech industry has grown in speed, 
                   companies, and creative ideas. However, as the industry continuously expands into nations all over
                   the world, it becomes important to reflect just how companies such as Google, Facebook, & Spotify 
                   helped paved the path for other companies today.

                    Each company started with a small problem that someone wanted to fix so that 
                    people would have a better experience; thanks to these creators, the world just continues to 
                    improve thanks to technology.
