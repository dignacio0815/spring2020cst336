                <h2>Spotify's start</h2>
                <pre>
                    Spotify started as a small startup in Stockholm, Sweden. It was founded by
                    Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon in 2006. Spotify was the answer to a growing
                    piracy problem the music industry faced. Eventually started as free with 
                    advertisements to moving to premium for 10 dollars a month, Spotify was 
                    a platform globablly known.
                </pre>
                <pre>
                    Spotify is now a well known music streaming platform used by millions. There will
                    always be a piracy problem but thanks to streaming services like Spotify, it helps
                    in reducing that percentage by giving payment to the creators.
